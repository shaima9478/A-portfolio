                            <h3 style="color: rgb(142, 165, 42);">Hawa Mahal</h3>
                            <p>Hawa Mahal, located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, is a striking five-story palace built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh. Designed by Lal Chand Ustad, it showcases a blend of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles. Constructed from red and pink sandstone, the palace features a 
                                distinctive facade with 953 small windows, known as jharokhas, adorned with intricate latticework.The palace was designed to allow the royal ladies to observe street festivals and daily life without being seen, adhering to the purdah system. Its lattice design facilitates natural ventilation, keeping the palace cool. Hawa Mahal offers panoramic views of the city and nearby landmarks such as the Jantar Mantar and City Palace.
                                A significant symbol of Jaipur's cultural heritage, Hawa Mahal represents the artistic and architectural prowess of the Rajput rulers. It is a major tourist attraction and part of the group of monuments in Jaipur recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Conservation efforts are regularly undertaken to preserve its historical and architectural integrity.</p>

                                <h3 style="color: rgb(142, 165, 42);">Jal Mahal</h3>
                                <p>Jal Mahal, located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, is a captivating example of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles. Built in the 18th century by Maharaja Madho Singh I, the palace was originally intended as a hunting lodge and summer retreat for the royal family. Its unique position in the center of the lake creates an enchanting view, particularly at sunrise and sunset, adding to its allure.

                                    The structure of Jal Mahal is composed of five floors, with four of them submerged under water during the rainy season, leaving only the top floor visible. Constructed from red sandstone, the palace showcases intricate carvings and detailed ornamental work typical of Rajput architecture, complemented by Mughal elements. This blend of styles highlights the artistic and cultural synthesis that was prevalent during its construction.
                                    
                                    Historically, Jal Mahal served as a site for royal leisure activities, especially duck hunting. In the early 21st century, the palace underwent significant restoration to preserve its structural integrity and aesthetic appeal. These efforts also included ecological initiatives aimed at revitalizing the lake and improving water quality, thereby supporting local wildlife and enhancing the environment.</p>
